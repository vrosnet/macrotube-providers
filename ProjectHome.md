A fix has been applied to the Macrotube Helper service - no need to update the client application as this has been done server side. Syndicated videos - Vevo - never worked and depending on content restrictions a fair number of Youtube videos may be unplayable depending on your regional location. Feedback on the Issues section please. **Posted 3 August 2014**

Central repository for video providers to MacroTube.

This project started to fix the out-of-the-box YouTube provider, which broke when YT changed their HTML. But feel free to add other video providers too.

This project is offered under the Apache License 2.0--do whatever you want with it. MacroTube itself is NOT open source, unless the author changed the licensing while I wasn't looking.

MacroTube used to be available on the Windows Media Center forum:
