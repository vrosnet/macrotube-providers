# Introduction #

Beta testers to join this group http://groups.google.com/group/macrotube-providers-discuss
and express an interest under the Beta Testers topic        https://groups.google.com/d/topic/macrotube-providers-discuss/raadFU1hncU/discussion.

At least 10 users required, especially those who use the youtube and youtubehd providers a lot, the more the better.


# Details #

The basic idea is to provide a source xml file which uses a helper app to get the video URL. The Helper App will pass the video url to a web service which will do the necessary parsing and return the video url.

No having to download and update provider xml files - a pain if your WMC is under your TV without a mouse or keyboard. It will start off with youtube and youtubehd support.

The trial has attracted 2000+ users so far. As such the trial will continue until the end of November 2012. After this point a video message will be displayed indicating that the trial has end and instructions on how to obtain a license will be provided.

# Roadmap #

The app will aim to incorporate all the existing MacroTube providers. There will be a license cost of $15. No additional cost if you have multiple WMC machines - users will be able to activate the license on up to 3 machines. If you get a new computer and already have 3 activations, you can transfer one of them to your new machine.

Existing providers and xml files will remain available and anyone can upload an xml file for any provider here. You do not have to pay for a license to use the community provided xml files.
